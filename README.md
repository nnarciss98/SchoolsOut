# SchoolsOut

This project is to showcase JPA/Hibernate. Using JPA/Hibernate we communicate with a database and we manage a DB containing students, courses and exams.


Project started.

  - [x] Part 0: Create the object models for the entities. With the defined relations between them.
  - [x] Part 1: Create the repository classes to manage actions for each type of entity.
  - [x] Part 2: Test to see if the repositories work and do their job properly.
---
  - [x] Extended functionalities to make it interactive with the user. I haven't fully implemented all the functinalities, just enough of them so that you can get an idea on how this is supposed to work (otherwise I would spend too much time on it instead of working on more important things, but you are free to take the code and expand on it as much as you want ^-^)
